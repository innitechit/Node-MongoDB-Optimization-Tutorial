This repository contains the source code and resources for the "Node Application Optimization with MongoDB" tutorial. 

Welcome to the Node.js MongoDB Optimization Tutorial repository! This repository contains all the necessary code and resources to follow along with our detailed tutorial on optimizing a Node.js application with MongoDB.

Overview
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to seamlessly integrate MongoDB into your Node.js application using Mongoose. We'll guide you through the process of:
